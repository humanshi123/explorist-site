    description: "Saskatchewan Saskatchewan is located on the Western Prairies between Alberta and Manitoba; with  friendly and helpful people supporting  excellent experiences. Join fun-loving Saskatchewan people at over 600 hundred special events this year. See bizarre races featuring gophers, chickens and rubber ducks. Enjoy the thrill of watching Dragon boats racing down the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon in early summer or see them on Wascana Lake in Regina as the summer ends. Or, kick off exhibition week in Saskatoon by watching the traditional Louis Riel Relay Race featuring canoeing, running and horseback riding. The Saskatchewan River becomes a raceway in mid-July with the River Roar Powerboat races. See these machines go over 200 km/hour and turn on a dime. They weave under the Victoria bridge in a blur.Travel to Regina for the Cathedral Arts Festival in May ( a fun, busking street fare) or try Bazaart in June on the grounds of the MacKenzie Art Gallery. This outdoor art and craft festival is the largest in Saskatchewan and has been running for over 25 years. similar event is Waterfront, held each August on the grounds of the Mendel Art Gallery in Saskatoon. If you are looking for the best in artisans, these festivals and many others, like the Saskatchewan Handcraft Festival held in July each year in the Battlefords will get you shopping. Relive the old west through frontier festivals and rough and tumble rodeos. Check out the rodeo in the community nearest you or see the All Star Pro Rodeo at Sask. Place in the fall. Check out Agribition or the Farm Progress Show, both in Regina. Vetavision, put on by the Western College of Veterinary Medicine is a great place to get close to the animals. Back to Batoche Days at Batoche are a wonderful way of relieving some of the traditional cultures of Saskatchewan's metis population. Attend a powwow at either the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in Regina, or one at Onion Lake or Prince Albert or any of the other Aboriginal celebrations that occur during the year. Special events at Saskatoon's Wanuskewin Park are worth the trip -- there is everything from dancing to sightseeing to games for everyone.In Saskatoon, watch a Shakespearian performance under a circus tent by the South Saskatchewan River, walk down Broadway Avenue and catch some of the Fringe Festival (alternative theatre) or attend the Flatland Music Festival in Victoria Park in Regina. The Ness Creek Music Festival, new to the province (just shy of a decade) occurs in midsummer in northern Saskatchewan. Mosaic, in Regina, and Folkfest, in Saskatoon, are two attractions not to miss out on. Both events showcase the diverse culture of Saskatchewan. Over twenty different ethnic pavilions at each festival offer food, entertainment and lots of culture. Saskatchewan has events for every taste. Country music's best performers shine at the Big Valley Jamboree. The Saskatchewan Jazz Festival brings the strains of Bourbon Street north to Saskatoon. The Snowbirds soar at the Saskatchewan Air Show in Moose Jaw, see the Canada Remembers Air Show in August in Saskatoon or watch the Saskatchewan Roughriders stage their own air display at Regina's Taylor Field. Children and parents can enjoy the Southern and Northern Children's Festival. Both are packed full of over five days of activities, plays, music, games and fun.  Whether you like thresherman's shows or folk festivals, fiddling championships or off-beat theater, you'll find good times - and great people - waiting for you. ",

    description: "Alberta is truly a beautiful place to visit in Canada, with so much to offer (especially if you love to be outside!).  the amazing rocky mountains of Banff, Jasper, and Waterton National Park, the rolling prairies, the dinosaur capital of the world and the badlands, the chance to see the Northern Lights, buffalo watching at Elk Island National Park, and SO MUCH more!! I feel lucky to live in a place that has so many interesting spots to explore!   Each season is super unique, with different activities and things to do in each month.Getting around can be difficult if you don’t have a car – so I highly recommend renting a vehicle or sign up for a tour or book seats on a shuttle bus.   Otherwise places like Edmonton, Calgary, and even Banff are very easy to get around using public transportation. Accommodation prices can really vary throughout the province, but the earlier you look the more likely you are to find something in your price range! And if you’re visiting Banff, look into staying just outside of the National Park in Canmore instead.Always be prepared for changing weather because it can be hard to predict, especially in the mountains!  And don’t forget to budget in the cost of a Canadian National Parks Pass if you’re planning to head to one of Alberta’s 5 national parks.Alberta is home to 5 National Parks, and they are all worth a visit if you are traveling Alberta for a while! If you have a vehicle and are stopping in one of these parks, you will need a proper Canadian National Parks pass.Waterton National ParkLocated in Southern Alberta, right by the border to Montana in the United States, Waterton National Park is an incredibly beautiful place to visit! In Waterton, the  mountains are somewhat  different than the mountains you see in the Rockies.  Waterton is also home to amazing hikes, including the Crypt Lake hike – which National Geographic named one of the most thrilling hikes in the world!Banff National ParkOf course, everyone knows Banff National Park. And just in case you don’t, you need to! Banff National Park is one of the best places you can add to your itinerary. It is the main spot to visit in the Rocky Mountains, with the cutest little mountain town, Banff, as the main and really only city in the National Park.Here you will also find world renown Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, and so many incredible outdoor adventures like hiking to the Lake Agnes Teahouse, swimming in Banff’s glacial lakes, one of the world’s most beautiful drives (the Icefields Parkway), and more!Kananaskis Provincial ParkKananaskis Provincial Park is located just outside of Banff and is a hikers dream. There are soo many amazing places to hike and camp here, it is worth a stop on any Alberta itinerary. One of my favorite spots in Kananaskis is the Blackshale Suspension Bridge, which isn’t too bad of a hike to visit! (and it is also free).Explore Alberta’s CitiesThere are quite a few cities and towns in Alberta, but the two main ones are Edmonton and Calgary!  If you’re visiting one of these cities and there is a hockey game happening, they can be so fun attend! The fans in Alberta can go crazy for hockey!EdmontonThe City of Edmonton is Alberta’s capital and is one of two cities with a major airport. Edmonton is a cool place to explore if you have the time, although I honestly wouldn’t go out of my way to visit!Some popular spots to check out include the Muttart Conservatory, University of Alberta Botanical Gardens, Fort Edmonton Park, and the river valley.  If visiting in the summer, there are a ton of festivals in Edmonton, such as K-Days, the Fringe, Taste of Edmonton, and Heritage Days.  You can also take a day trip to Elk Island National Park from Edmonton!CalgaryCalgary is the city that most people will fly into when visiting Alberta, and is a good base to explore from!  The City of Calgary is only an hour drive from Banff, an hour and a half to Drumheller (Alberta’s badlands), and just under 3 hours to Waterton National Park.   If you’re spending some time in Calgary, I would recommend checking out Prince’s Island Park, the Calgary Zoo, or go to the top of the Calgary Tower.See the Badlands in Dinosaur Country-DrumhellerDrumheller is a town located in the heart of dinosaur country and is a pretty close drive from Calgary. Here you’ll find landscapes of the badlands, the world’s largest dinosaur, and the chance to discover fossils.  Another provincial park nearby Calgary where you can see the badlands is Dinosaur Provincial Park. You can camp at both of these spots and it is a really cool landscape to see!  Drumheller also has a super cool dinosaur museum called the Royal Tyrell Museum. It is one of the world’s largest places where you can see dinosaur fossils, and is an awesome spot to explore whether you are an adult or a kid!  850 - 2024-05-27",
