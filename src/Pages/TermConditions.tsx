          <p>
            Each order you place shall be deemed to be an offer by you to
            purchase the goods and/or services specified within it subject to
            the Terms and Conditions and the applicable details on the product
            page.
          </p>
          <p>
            No order shall be deemed to be accepted by the VENDOR until we
            (acting as the commercial agent of the VENDOR) issue an email
            acknowledgment of order to yourself and the VENDOR. The contract
            between you and a VENDOR will relate only to those goods and/or
            services notified in the email acknowledgment of order.

          <h2>7. Payment Methods</h2>
          <p>
            Purchases for goods and/or services you make with VENDORS may only
            be paid for using a debit or credit card through our payment
            facility (or any other payment method which we may make available
            from time to time). In accepting or otherwise processing your
            payments related to the purchase of items from VENDORS, we act in
            the capacity as commercial agent of the VENDOR. The VENDOR
            acknowledges and agrees that the valid payment by you to us for the
            purchase of item(s) between you and the VENDOR will satisfy your
            obligation to pay the VENDOR for the relevant item(s) and
            consequently, any debt obligations owed by you to the VENDOR for the
            purchase of such items shall be extinguished at that time. The
            VENDOR further agrees that it will not seek recourse (legal or
            otherwise) against you for payment of items if you have validly paid
            us.
          </p>
          <p>
            All prices shall be shown in the applicable currency and payable in
            that currency. You accept that some banks may charge you an
            additional fee for certain transactions (for example, international
            transactions) and credit card companies for transaction fees. You
            accept that item prices in the currencies displayed do not vary
            according to your location; delivery charges will vary depending on
            the delivery destination.

            liable to you or any third party by reason of so refusing or by
